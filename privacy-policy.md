# Fiverr Gig Finder - Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [Month Day, Year]_

## Overview
Fiverr Gig Finder is a Chrome extension that helps users discover relevant Fiverr freelancers based on the website they are browsing. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## Information We Collect
The extension **does not collect, store, or share any personal information** from users.

We only process minimal, non-personal data required to perform the extension’s functionality:
- The current active tab URL (used only when you click the extension icon)
- User preferences stored locally in Chrome storage (for example, category filters or settings)

This information is **never sent to external servers** or shared with third parties.

## Permissions Explanation
The extension requests the following permissions:
- **activeTab** – to access the URL of the active tab when you click the extension icon, allowing Fiverr gig recommendations to be generated.
- **storage** – to save user preferences locally for a better experience.
- **https://www.fiverr.com/** – to fetch and display Fiverr gig data directly from Fiverr’s public API.

No additional data is collected, and no background tracking occurs.

## Use of Remote Code
The extension connects only to trusted Fiverr endpoints to retrieve public gig listings and images. No third-party or untrusted scripts are loaded remotely.

## Data Security
All data processed by the extension remains local to your device. We do not use external databases or analytics tools.

## Third-Party Links
Our extension may include links to Fiverr.com. Once you click these links, you are subject to Fiverr’s own Privacy Policy.
